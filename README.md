## Exercise: Geometric Shapes

#### Objective:

Practice using polymorphism in Java by creating a program that calculates and displays the areas of different geometric shapes.

#### Description:

You should create a set of classes representing geometric shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) and their areas. Each shape class should have a method called calculateArea() that calculates and returns the area of that specific shape. Create a class called ShapeCalculator that demonstrates the use of polymorphism to calculate and display the areas of various shapes.

#### Guidelines:

#### Geometric Shape Classes:

Create three classes: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle, each representing a different geometric shape.
Each shape class should have a method called calculateArea() that returns the area of that shape. For example, the Circle class might have double calculateArea(double radius).

#### ShapeCalculator Class:

Create a class called ShapeCalculator that demonstrates polymorphism.

In ShapeCalculator, create an array of shape objects that includes instances of Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Pass the required parameters to each shape's calculateArea() method.

Use a loop to iterate through the array and display the calculated areas.
